## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **PostgreSQL**: Download and install from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal (command prompt) and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ApoorvaSharma12/my-blog-project.git
   cd my-blog-project
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): This keeps your project dependencies isolated.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages: Make sure you have a requirements.txt file in your project directory. If not, you can create it with the necessary dependencies. Then, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can manually install Django and any other required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install django psycopg2-binary django-taggit
Set up the PostgreSQL database:

Open PostgreSQL and create a new database for the project (e.g., my_blog_db).
You can use pgAdmin or the command line to create the database.
Configure the database settings: Open settings.py in your Django project and update the DATABASES settings with your database credentials. For example:

python
Copy code
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'my_blog_db',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}
Apply migrations: Run the following command to create the necessary database tables:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser (to access the Django admin):

bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to create your superuser account.

Run the development server: Start the server with the following command:

bash
